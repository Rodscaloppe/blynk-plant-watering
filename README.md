# Plant Watering with ESP8266 and Blynk App
This project was created to fill in the gap we had while going for holidays: Our flowers and plants needed to be watered and I was too busy to create a complex system.
I decided to uyse the simplicity of Blynk as it requires low to almost no need of messing up with code and hardware.

## Needed material:
   - 1x NodeMCU or similar ESP8266 unit with access to I/O
   - 1x Relay board (to control the water pump)
   - 2x DS18S20 1-Wire digital thermometer (I used the ones soldered already on a long cable)
   - 1x Soil moisture sensor (analog, with 3 pins)
   - 1x Mini water pump (12V)
   - 2x Power supply (5V USB for the NodeMCU + 12V for the water pump)
   - OPTIONAL: 1x Voltage regulator module (in case you just want to use a 12V power supply and generate the 5V from it)
